#Python Hobby Projects

A collection of small python projects created while learning Python programming fundamentals.
Each project focuses on practicing different aspects of Python ,basic logic to object-oriented programming.

##Projects

##Skills Acquired
    1.Python basics:variables,loops,functions 
    2.Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)
    3.File handling and user input
    4.Error handling
    5.Problem solving with small projects
    6.Building terminal apps

##Future Improvements
  1.Add GUI versions for some projects e.g expense tracker or student grade tracker.
  2.Apply Software Engineering principles e.g Seperation of concerns,SOLID principles
  3.Expand functionality of games and trackers
  4.Save and load data in files or database

##How to run
  1.Install Python 3 ([Python.org](https://www.python.org/))
  2.Open terminal in project folder
  3.Run the project

'''bash
  python filename.py or py filename.
